Simon classic game

How it works:

Mouse click the correct buttons in the order given

Follow the sound and lit up color to score a correct answer

Complete a sequence of 10 and you win!

Note: wait until the sequence is finished before you start pressing again the buttons, or it may not register the move.

When you click on the wrong color, an alert saying " Try again" will pop up accompanied by a defeat sound.

When you click on the right color, an alert saying "Correct!" will pop up, with a winning sound.
